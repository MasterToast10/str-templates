\begin{document}
	\maketitle

	\section{Introduction}
		% TODO: Introduction
		Journal paper should be written a maximum of 7 pages excluding references section.
		On the bottom of the page, list up to six keywords that reflect the content of the paper arranged alphabetically (Santos, 2016). % This is personal communication

		An Introduction should describe the paper’s background and provide the rationale for the present study.
		Cite only those references that will provide the most relevant background rather than an exhaustive review of the topic (Santos \& Reyes, 2017). % This is personal communication too

	\section{Methodology}
		% TODO: Methodology
		\subsection{Subheading for Procedure 1}
			Methods should be described concisely and clearly to allow experiments to be repeated.
			For commonly used methods, a simple reference is sufficient.
			Avoid references that are not readily accessible.

	\section{Results}
		% TODO: Results
		\subsection{Subheading for Result 1}
			In Results, present data in only one of the following: text, table, or figure.
			Results should preferably have no more than five illustrations (tables and/or figures).
			Do not use tables or figures to present data that can be more concisely stated in the text.
			Discussion should interpret results in relation to previously published work.
			Do not repeat results or reiterate the introduction.

						Never use vertical lines to separate columns.
						Prepare tables so that compared data read down, not across.
						Columns that show no significant variations should be omitted.
						Do not use tables for word lists.
						Titles should be clear, and column headings should be brief with units of measurements in parentheses.
						Symbols and abbreviations should be defined below the table.
						Indicate table footnotes with a, b, c, etc.
						Do not present the same data in both graphical and tabular form.
						Tables should be self-explanatory or understandable without reference to the text.
